# RTLola-Ros2-Monitor

ROS 2 adapter for CISPA's RTLola monitoring interpreter.

The adapter assumes a running ROS 2 workspace, i.e., `ros2 topic list` returns a list of topics that are currently executed. The adapter will then automatically generate RTLola input stream binding for all available topic data. If a topic called `RTLolaOut` is an available interace, i.e. `ros2 interface list`, it will also generate a binding to the respective RTLola outputs. 

For more RTLola information see [here](https://rtlola.cispa.de/).

A comprehensive RTLola tutorial can be found [here](https://rtlola.cispa.de/playground/tutorial).
